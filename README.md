# GopherServer
Fun little Gopher Server on localhost
Enter a path to your own directory and a port number.
Then use telnet localhost <port> on the command line to have your files displayed to you as
though they were coming through a gopher server!

Only capable of opening text files. Put the "Gopher Test" folder within a reachable directory for a couple of
examples.
