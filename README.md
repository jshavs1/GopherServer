# GopherServer
Fun little Gopher Server on localhost
Enter a path to your own directory and a port number.
Then use "telnet localhost port#" on the command line to have your files displayed to you as
though they were coming through a gopher server!

Only capable of opening text files. Put test.txt files in a directory reachable by your given path
for a couple examples.
